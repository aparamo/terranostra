    "caroBio1": "I'm Carolina Lara, I studied Ecology and later specialized in natural resource management and rural development. For many years I worked in rural communities on projects related to land use change and territorial and landscape planning, as well as some productive projects.",
    "caroBio2": "Later, I had the opportunity to take a course on organic agriculture and permaculture that completely changed my professional and personal perspective. It allowed me to realize the system we live in and above all to reflect on our life model, the food production system, contact with nature and the relationship between our self-care and caring for the planet.",
    "caroBio3": "Currently, I dedicate myself to ecological design and complement it with tools such as coaching, seeking that designs take into account not only environmental conditions but also the needs and interests of users, and that the benefits of a garden or green area are environmentally sustainable and generate benefits at the mental and emotional level.",
    "adriBio1": "Permaculture and political agroecology changed my life. First I studied sustainable development at Colmex in the LEAD program, then I worked at a well-known Mexican climate foundation and eventually I went to live in the countryside to plant and experiment with living in other ways.",
    "adriBio2": "I have made gardens, managing to feed up to 23 families each month, I have participated in the design and implementation of a couple of projects of 1 hectare or a little less, planting medicinal gardens, implementing greenhouses, seed houses, chicken coops, biofactories and more.",
    "adriBio3": "I believe that the fact that I have worked with the land for more than 10 years allows me to give a more grounded vision with greater experience, as well as better recommendations and results for anyone who wants to collaborate with us.",
